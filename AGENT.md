## Required wrap-up after coding
After you finish ANY coding work (including edits, refactors, tests, docs):
1) Invoke `$file-progress-followup`.
2) Ensure `CODING_PROGRESS.md` is updated before you reply.
If you cannot update the file, explain why and still provide the per-file progress table in chat.
